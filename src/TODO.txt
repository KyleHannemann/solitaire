Things I learned:

-Slow Down, methodically plan out app so I dont have to
fix so many bugs that I create. If I am more precise in creating then I will spend less
time in the long run.

-set up api/server first

-Keep language consistent. put all my props in same place on each component.
keep each component more organized that way.

-get user Id as soon as logged in so I can use it in my req params,
rather than having to validate username and password every time.







BUGS:

 

-win percentage?
















TODO:



-Title on homepage/login



-auto complete button;
- add sound
