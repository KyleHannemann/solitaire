Things I learned:

-Slow Down, methodically plan out app so I dont have to
fix so many bugs that I create. If I am more precise in creating then I will spend less
time in the long run.

-set up api/server first

-DONOT repeat myself as often!
    I spent too much time debuging code that was repeated
    I need to plan out my functions and variable better in order to reuse them as often as possible


-use least amount of data and variables as possible:
I created new variables to see if card was faceup when i could have just checked the card image to see if faceup.
This caused more room for error and made me have to keep track of more moving pieces.


-Keep language consistent. put all my props in same place on each component.
keep each component more organized that way.

-get user Id as soon as logged in so I can use it in my req params,
rather than having to validate username and password every time.
